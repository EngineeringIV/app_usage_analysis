196,649,2,Game,Graphic Intensive,Dead Cells Series,"Requires an internet connection. Early Access Game Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops. About the game Dead Cells is a rogue-lite metroidvania action-platformer. You'll explore a sprawling ever-changing castle... assuming you're able to fight your way past its keepers in 2D  souls-lite combat  No checkpoints. Kill die learn repeat. Roguelike Rogue-lite roguelike-like rogueschmike! No matter what you call them the world could always use another! As such we'd like to present for your consideration the illegitimate child of the roguelite and the metroidvania the RogueVANIA. Anywho enough with the sales pitch let's take a closer look. By metroidVania we're really talking about a fixed hand designed interconnected world. The game takes place on an immense island that never changes. All of the biomes bosses and the paths between them are present right from the start. Getting to them is another story... However in Dead Cells death replaces the traditional backtracking mechanic of a metroidvania. At first seemingly unreachable areas will be strewn across your path but answers to these riddles will appear as you explore the island. Be it a key a new acrobatic skill or a forgotten spell. Once uncovered this knowledge will stay with you allowing you to unlock new paths to your goal. Sick of the stinking sewers? Head over the ramparts and take a breath of fresh air! It's your skill playstyle and of course the loot you find that will determine your path. Furthermore as the term RogueVania might (not so) subtly imply we were also quite heavily influenced by the recent wave of roguelites. When there are no checkpoints to save you from your screw-ups the adrenaline kicks in. And when you lose you lose big so you've got to make it out alive. Instead of relying on the classic formula of memorising the level design and enemy placement procedural generation allows us to reward your instincts reflexes and ability to adapt to evolving situations. Having said this we're conscious that the words  procedural generation  conjure up images of crappy levels and uninteresting gameplay in a lot of gamers' minds. So we've chosen a hybrid solution with each run being a mashup of carefully designed  chunks  of level. The idea is to give you the feeling of meticulously handcrafted world while making sure you have a new experience every time. Don't expect it to be a walk in the park though. Pattern based monsters and demanding boss fights will teach you to choose your battles and build your strength. Every weapon has its own unique feel and rolling and dodging will become second nature as you learn to manage the mobs of monsters that will overwhelm the unprepared. We're going after that  tough but fair  feeling. Tired of the violence and death? Explore a bit take a stroll enjoy the view from the ramparts find a secret room. Thomas and Gwen our graphic artists never miss an opportunity to impress with their pixelart and shape a world worth exploring. You might even learn a little more about the lore of the place who knows? Key Features RogueVania The progressive exploration of an interconnected world with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath. Souls-lite combat Pattern-based bosses and minions weapons and spells with unique gameplay. Make do with what you have and don't forget to roll. Nonlinear progression Unlock new levels with every death and explore undiscovered parts of the island as you prepare for the inevitable bosses. Exploration Secret rooms hidden passages charming landscapes. Death is the new backtracking.
