532,0,Game,General,4th Generation Warfare,the game Fourth-Generation Warfare simulates warfare in the 21st century which in addition to the direct opposition of military forces now includes espionage international politics cyberwarfare media manipulation and trade wars. As the leader of a nation dispatch and control your team of characters all around the world to destabilize your enemies and establish your supremacy. All methods are fair game: hacking sabotage political interference military strikes corruption treachery assassinations energy domination data theft 4GW turn-based game combines a strategy game with a role playing game. Key features Gameplay On each turn the player as the head of a nation can carry out a limited number of actions with the characters that he or she controls. Each character performs actions specific to their position or function (examples: contract negotiations for a diplomat sabotage for a spy cyberattacks for a hacker inquiries for an investigator). You can also opt to move military units or for actions called leverage (examples: invitation to a restaurant offering a bribe threatening with blackmail) performed by non-playable characters allowing you to later compel them to commit acts of betrayal. More than 100 different actions are possible. The psychological profile experience and abilities of the characters possession of weapons and particular objects factor into their odds of success. During your turn other nations controlled by human players or by the AI can also perform actions. All throughout the game a news website and characters' smartphones inform the player of action results and other game events. The score of each country is based on 4 criteria (international diplomacy military conquest economic performance popularity) and establishes a ranking. The last country standing or the first-ranked country after the last turn wins the game. Optional secret objectives can also tip the balance towards victory. The Real 21st Century The game is played on a current map of the world viewable in 2D and in 3D. The map shows all national borders cities and important strategic locations (military bases power plants factories...). The player can access city maps with its various buildings (palace of the Head of State headquarters of the army secret services or the police restaurants embassies characters' residences secret hideouts) and interact with the characters in those locations. Certain buildings have a computer server for their operations and contain databases of sensitive information; they can be targets for cyberattacks aimed at blocking or stealing this data. Maps of the major capitals are consistent with the real-world cities. There are various map display modes: diplomatic military electoral etc; there is also a minimap. The world map changes according to players' building projects damage from war or sabotage military strategies and territorial conquests. Moreover all major events are displayed on the affected areas (demonstrations attacks crimes...) Multiple Characters with a Wide Range of Skills and Psychologies There are more than 30 types of characters. Characters controlled by the player (spies police inspectors cabinet members military leaders) are distinct from non-playable characters who can only be influenced (spouses journalists traffickers hitmen informants religious dignitaries artists psychoanalysts ...). Each character has a particular psychological profile helping or hindering the success of their actions. Around fifteen different profiles are represented: sociable loyal charismatic paranoid introverted Moreover variables of stress and fear calculated according to events (threats corruption) can influence their autonomic behavior (surrender betrayal coup dtat...) Characters also have a smartphone with which they can manage their contacts talk to them negotiate with them arrange a meeting or store their files (stolen data photo or video evidence...). These telephones can be GPS-tracked or hacked and their contents pilfered. About thirty special objects can be found or constructed and add bonus or additional skills to characters like: bulletproof vests fake IDs compound cameras explosives exoskeletons... Actions common to all characters (moving going to a restaurant taking/placing/giving/stealing objects seducing threatening marrying/divorcing interacting bribing) are distinguished from actions specific to their profession. Examples of specific actions by type of character: Head of State: appoint cabinet members set budget guidelines denounce the UN approve nuclear weapons campaign in elections begin infrastructure projects Secretary of Diplomacy and Diplomats: implement commercial contracts sign strategic agreements vote in the UN open embassies Head of Secret Services and Spys: infiltrate sabotage assassinate spy kidnap... Cyber-Analysts: hack into a server or smartphone GPS tracking plant viruses reinforce data protection trace the source of a cyberattack Head of the Army: implement arms deals construct bases manage staff declare martial law Secretary of Interior and Police Investigators: use video surveillance investigate crimes and offenses make arrests interrogate a suspect conduct a stakeout monitor a building break up demonstrations... Non-playable characters are also capable of many specific actions: editing articles for journalists ordering union strikes influential sermons by religious dignitaries exhibitions for artists assassination by a hitman voting instructions for political leaders... A Reactive but Still Influenced Population The happiness level of the population is calculated on each turn. It can vary according to the policies of the state (social spending level of taxation) unemployment rate purchasing power that changes according to product costs potential shortages anxiety levels in the country or the corruption of the leaders. Angry people can start demonstrations or riots call for a strike and ultimately cause the player to lose the game. The people can also be influenced by the manipulation of information in the media or by natural leaders such as union or party leaders by religious dignitaries who themselves can be in service of a foreign power. A Multitude of Strategies The multitude of action plans (limited in each turn and must be carefully considered) combined with different ways to calculate scores offers players a multitude of strategies. The different levels of underlying gameplay such as wargames featuring around fifty different types of military units trade wars via economic contracts management of the national budget to influence popularity via your investment capacity management of resources the role of the UN who can sanction a country or authorize military interventions all add even more to the possibilities and the excitement of the game with fortunes changing at any moment.

637,11,Game,Early Access,Curse of the Dead Gods,Requires an internet connection. Early access game Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops. About the game You seek untold riches eternal life divine powers - it leads to this accursed temple a seemingly-infinite labyrinth of bottomless pits deadly traps and monsters. Use weapons the environment your brains and skills to defeat the temple Collect mystical Relics and an arsenal of weapons to make yourself unstoppable. Battle through hordes of enemies in dark cavernous passages filled with traps and secrets of all sorts - fire-spewing statues explosives hidden spikes and worse.

Greed will kill you greed will save you Your greed will lead you to death but that is not an escape. Rise to fight again. Delve deeper again. Defy the malignant deities that linger in this place. Key features A skill-based roguelike exploring a cruel dark temple made of endless rooms and corridors Swords spears bows guns - wield these and many more Light and fire will be your best allies to overcome the threats that lie in the shadows Unique curses influence each attempt putting a twist on every action Dozens of enemies with powerful champions and deadly bosses to face off against What the developers have to say Why Early Access?  Curse of the Dead Gods is a passion project and one with a huge variety of possible development directions. We want to get community feedback and opinions on what the best thing to do would be. It is also a modular and replayable game which we think fits Early Access to a tee. Naturally we have a development roadmap and a plan to get to release but we're willing - and indeed excited - to adapt and change as the community finds what they love about our game. We're also interested in developing the story and world-building across a decent period and Early Access is the perfect fit for that. Early Access will start early 2020. Until then we are running First Explorer tests outside of Steam which you can see on the official site. These are limited extremely early stage tests but it's also free to sign-up - check the official website for more. Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?  We have a plan to launch before the end of 2020. However no development plan can possibly survive contact with feedback (Sun-Tzu said that) so we will be delighted to extend this timeframe if there is more to work on. Naturally we'll keep you updated far in advance on potential release dates. How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?  The final version of Curse of the Deads Gods will feature three full sections each focused on a different god plus many more weapons curses relics and other things we can't wait to show you. There's also a lot to expand and improve on in every system once feedback starts flooding in so we expect to update everything from the combat system to the UI between now and full launch. Throughout Early Access we plan to do large monthly updates alongside smaller patches roughly weekly. Some of these may be unstable and will use a special branch so that the core game is never in a messy state. What is the current state of the Early Access version?  Curse of the Dead Gods is a fully-featured roguelite with a challenging curve tight combat and dozens of weapons relics curses rooms traps and much more to discover. All the core systems are in place but in at-most-beta state. Major changes can and will happen based on your feedback and we're excited to get started. The Jaguar section that makes up the current version of the game should be considered a little under a third of the final planned content. However as each run is randomised there is plenty to discover in just this first segment. Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?  We intend to increase the price alongside the introduction of new content. How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?  Discord forums Twitter smoke signal inscribed runes reading the intestines of pigs hastily scrawled messages written on dungeon walls in blood - we're interested in every piece of feedback you can give us and every way you might do it. We have in-built telemetry so simply by playing the game you'll assist in the balancing process. Beyond that we welcome you to talk to us however you like with opinions and requests. We're a small team and won't be able to implement every brilliant suggestion we receive but we can't wait to make the game you want to play as good as possible. system requirements Windows - Minimum OS: Windows 7/8/10 Processor: Intel Core i3-2125 (3.3 GHz)/AMD FX-4100 (3.6 GHz) RAM: 4 GB RAM Graphics card: 2 GB GeForce GTX 660/Radeon R7 370 HDD: 2 GB Windows - Recommended OS: Windows 7/8/10 Processor: Intel Core i7-3820 (3.6 GHz)/AMD FX-8350 (4.0 GHz) RAM: 8 GB RAM Graphics card: 2 GB GeForce GTX 760/Radeon R9 280 HDD: 2 GB  2020 Curse of the Dead Gods developed by Passtech Games published by Focus Home Interactive.

640,0,Game,General,Dark Matter,THE GAME Dark Matter is a 2.5D side-scrolling survival horror game set in a derelict spaceship besieged by a sinister alien presence and infested with deadly parasites. As the Ensign you must explore fetid hallways and abandoned facilities scavenging for parts and blueprints expanding your arsenal to up to four deadly weapons and freely customize each to fit your combat style against intelligent reactive enemies. Dark Matter delivers a hard-hitting take on the survival horror genre in deep space with a heavy emphasis on tactical combat and exploration. Story: Out of breath you run into the door slamming against its cold metal surface. The clicking of scuttling claws recedes into the distance swallowed by the pitch black oblivion behind you. You know better than to feel safe. There are too many infested at your back and another blank metal door ahead. With a quick reflex you check your ammo supplies and slot a fresh magazine into your shotgun. With a quicker prayer you flick the switch and open the door. The metal jaws open on endless night you don't dare pierce with your flashlight not to disturb those things that live in shadow. By the pale bioluminescence that washes up from the floor grates you piece together the picture of a corridor and what could be a stretch of exploding pods. Just beyond the silhouette of a fully grown crawler stirs. Grinning in the dark you turn on the weapon's flashlight and point it straight down the corridor. Predictably the blisters swell up to full irritation ready to explode at the slightest touch. The crawler turns to hiss at you instantly aroused by the light and your presence. In your mind's eye it dumbly rushes forward into the blister pods to kill itself saving you precious ammo. It takes a precious moment to adjust to reality when the sleek shape crouches and jumps towards you instead. There is time for just one panicked shot before the inevitable flight as you run for your life barely keeping ahead of the claws slashing for you. In a moment of adrenaline-fuelled inspiration you slam the wall panel as you retreat past the chamber's door. The heavy powerful mechanism smoothly slices the crawler in half just before the critter can reach and disembowel you. There is no time to congratulate yourself as you hear a familiar hissing from above... KEY FEATURES 14 levels in a gritty tale of deep space survival 4 weapons each with 4 ammo types. Elemental ammo effects that allow you to freeze dissolve electrocute or set fire to your enemies. Four craftable upgrades to customize your weapons. Collect scrap and alien resources to craft your own tools and health packs. Invest in the weapons and upgrades you prefer develop your own combat techniques. Non-linear exploration and storytelling with complex enemy AI that reacts to the player's actions and tactics. Light and darkness are integral parts of gameplay not just visual touches. Uncompromisingly real-time lights and shadow casting for spine-tingling moments of pure darkness-fuelled terror. Clean hand-painted textures and custom shading techniques are combined in a unique visual style. Dynamic soundtrack that adapts to gameplay circumstances.

649,11,Game,Early Access,Dead Cells Series,"Requires an internet connection. Early Access Game Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops. About the game Dead Cells is a rogue-lite metroidvania action-platformer. You'll explore a sprawling ever-changing castle... assuming you're able to fight your way past its keepers in 2D  souls-lite combat  No checkpoints. Kill die learn repeat. Roguelike Rogue-lite roguelike-like rogueschmike! No matter what you call them the world could always use another! As such we'd like to present for your consideration the illegitimate child of the roguelite and the metroidvania the RogueVANIA. Anywho enough with the sales pitch let's take a closer look. By metroidVania we're really talking about a fixed hand designed interconnected world. The game takes place on an immense island that never changes. All of the biomes bosses and the paths between them are present right from the start. Getting to them is another story... However in Dead Cells death replaces the traditional backtracking mechanic of a metroidvania. At first seemingly unreachable areas will be strewn across your path but answers to these riddles will appear as you explore the island. Be it a key a new acrobatic skill or a forgotten spell. Once uncovered this knowledge will stay with you allowing you to unlock new paths to your goal. Sick of the stinking sewers? Head over the ramparts and take a breath of fresh air! It's your skill playstyle and of course the loot you find that will determine your path. Furthermore as the term RogueVania might (not so) subtly imply we were also quite heavily influenced by the recent wave of roguelites. When there are no checkpoints to save you from your screw-ups the adrenaline kicks in. And when you lose you lose big so you've got to make it out alive. Instead of relying on the classic formula of memorising the level design and enemy placement procedural generation allows us to reward your instincts reflexes and ability to adapt to evolving situations. Having said this we're conscious that the words  procedural generation  conjure up images of crappy levels and uninteresting gameplay in a lot of gamers' minds. So we've chosen a hybrid solution with each run being a mashup of carefully designed  chunks  of level. The idea is to give you the feeling of meticulously handcrafted world while making sure you have a new experience every time. Don't expect it to be a walk in the park though. Pattern based monsters and demanding boss fights will teach you to choose your battles and build your strength. Every weapon has its own unique feel and rolling and dodging will become second nature as you learn to manage the mobs of monsters that will overwhelm the unprepared. We're going after that  tough but fair  feeling. Tired of the violence and death? Explore a bit take a stroll enjoy the view from the ramparts find a secret room. Thomas and Gwen our graphic artists never miss an opportunity to impress with their pixelart and shape a world worth exploring. You might even learn a little more about the lore of the place who knows? Key Features RogueVania The progressive exploration of an interconnected world with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath. Souls-lite combat Pattern-based bosses and minions weapons and spells with unique gameplay. Make do with what you have and don't forget to roll. Nonlinear progression Unlock new levels with every death and explore undiscovered parts of the island as you prepare for the inevitable bosses. Exploration Secret rooms hidden passages charming landscapes. Death is the new backtracking.

After numerous wars and several environmental disasters only two world powers remain; the United Civilized States covering the American continent Western Europe and North Africa and the Eurasian Dynasty covering the coherent landmasses of Eastern Europe and Asia.

HISTORY Only a few thousand humans managed to escape from the Earth before its collapse in 2150 A.D. They spent the next few years on the terra forming of the red planet developing new technologies and building up new civilisations. Somehow each of the three fractions Eurasian Dynasty United Civilised States and Lunar Corporation did this independently and separately from each other - but in the year 2160 something strange happens in this new world. If ED UCS and LC join forces or continue their old war against each other - is possibly now up to the player. Beside the usual venues in the solar system there are some strange looking locations: planets with moving and reflecting liquid surfaces. And beside the standard RTS - resources acquisition base building and destruction of enemy bases the year 2160 will have some adventure inspired tasks for the players. PAYABLE PARTIAL CONFLICTING BASIC PARTIES ED - the Eurasian Dynasty escaped on board an evacuation fleet. Now they are fighting for the survival of the human species. Their base is one large building comprising of smaller variable parts. LC - (Lunar Corporation) - This peace loving Matriarchal society has to fight to find a new base and home after the destruction of the Earth. LC buildings are built one on top of the other similar to a skyscraper but with one big difference. They have the ability to defy all the laws of gravity to move quickly to a new location. UCS - (United Civilized States) - these machines evolved from the UCS battle machines. During the long flight to Mars the computer decided to kill all human survivors and then initiated a plan to conquer the Solar system with its own mechanical army. ALIENS - alien renegades were imprisoned a long ago deep in the unknown history of Mars. In 2160 landing UCS ships awoke them from their deanimation. Now they are trying to escape their prison and to establish new bases in the solar system. All character parties have the possibility of developing new technologies. Work on technology is done in research centres on the planet surfaces. Each species can develop as many technologies at one time as they have technology centres.

A new Shogun seizes power over Japan and enforces nationwide peace. In his battle against conspiracy and rebellion he recruits five specialists with extraordinary skills for assassination sabotage and espionage. But how much are they really willing to sacrifice in the name of peace? Shadow Tactics is a hardcore tactical stealth game set in Japan around the Edo period. Take control of a team of deadly specialists and sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles snowy mountain monasteries or hidden forest camps. Set traps poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact.

The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons. One of the leaders of this team is Hayato an agile ninja who clears the way through his enemies silently with his sword and shuriken. Samurai Mugen prefers a more powerful approach and can defeat more fiends at one time but thus also forfeiting flexibility.

How can they best master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish enemies and complete missions.

995,0,Game,General,The Political Machine 2020,the game Win the hearts and minds of America's voters and take the 2020 presidential election by storm in this exciting political strategy game. Candidates include current Democratic front-runners like Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg as well as Internet favorites such as Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard. Republican candidates include Donald Trump George W. Bush and Mitt Romney. Don't like any of the current candidates? No problem just create your own! Or if you believe everything is going to hell in a handbasket play as the Giant Meteor and adopt some truly wild ideologies (ban all video games - they'll rot your brain!). The Political Machine 2020 features brand new unique ideology trees for candidates which allows them to play very differently from each other. Throughout the game you'll visit Town Halls to gain ideology points that you will be able to spend to own certain issues. For instance Bernie Sanders has  Medicare for All' as an issue he can own while Donald Trump can use points to purchase the  Build the Wall' issue. Each issue is modded on a per-state basis with their voter support based on data in order to allow for an accurate simulation of how those issues will play out in different states. It's important to win 270 votes in the electoral college so you'll need to pay attention to what issues voters care about in the swing states. What plays well in Texas or California might hurt you in Ohio or Florida. The Political Machine 2020 is a complete rewrite of the original versions of the game with vastly improved graphics and a more sophisticated simulation that combines polling data voter enthusiasm and the most recent US census results to deliver a game that is both fun to play for casual players and realistic enough for political wonks. Do you think you have what it takes? Take to the campaign trail and show the nation why you should be the next President of the United States of America! Key features Spread your Ideology - Participate in Town Hall events to earn ideology points and solidify your position on hot issues with your voters. Generate Enthusiasm - Use your power and money to purchase ads to discredit your opponent and influence voters. The greater enthusiasm your base has for an issue the more effective your ad campaigns will be. Participate in Interviews - Accept invitations to various talk shows across the country in order to share your opinion on issues important to the American people. Choose your Candidate - Play as one of several candidates each with their own custom stats like stamina intelligence charisma media bias and more. Manage your Campaign Budget - Purchase advertisements travel across the country to campaign and hire operatives to enhance your PR or cripple your opponent. Be wary - if you overspend and need extra cash it might come from somewhere that will shake voters' confidence in you! Create a Candidate - Customize your own front runner and race for the White House. Practice your Politics - A sophisticated underlying simulation model uses census data and real issues to test your political savvy. Be Ready for Anything - Torrid affairs natural disasters email scandals and other  breaking news  events can pop up and change the direction of the campaign for better or worse. Check your Standings - With poll tracking and leaderboards you can see how well people are playing as their candidates or what issues they are supporting over time.

Will you succeed in sweeping your rivals from the seven seas and leading your shipping line to global success and renown? TransOcean 2: Rivals the second chapter of the successful business simulation TransOcean offers days of entertaining play either alone in its three single-player modes Campaign Endless Game and Competition - or with friends in a thrilling competitive multiplayer mode. Get started with your newly founded shipping line in one of 60 ports and begin your career with a small fleet of worn-out old Feeders the smallest type of ship in TransOcean 2: Rivals. Choose your port wisely and complete your first contracts to nearby ports in order to generate your first funds. Conduct your business with brains plan your voyages with foresight and don't underestimate external factors like the price of oil or your rival companies. This is how you will slowly expand your fleet and establish subsidiaries across the whole world. Are you up to mastering all the challenges? A livelier economic system influencing all kinds of goods ensures that in TransOcean 2: Rivals you are also faced with macroeconomic challenges. With the three types of ships - Tankers Container Ships and Bulk Carriers - you have even more options to specialize and take your company to the top. Challenge your rivals and develop your own global business enterprise. In the single-player mode you can also give yourself a very unique challenge: Steer your ships directly in a variety of 3D environments when the tugboats go on strike and the going gets tough. Can you maneuver both small and large vessels undamaged through the harbor basin? The Campaign You already made it years ago. You paid off that hard-nosed investor and were the most successful shipping magnate on all the seven seas. But then something went wrong! Your shipping empire collapsed and what's more - your old consultant and friend Hiram T. Witherspoon ended up behind bars. Now you're living the life of a recluse as a dog sled pilot in Alaska. But your desire to help Hiram and put a stop to your adversary Lydia Blythe-Smith's plans drives you back to the world's ports. Have you got what it takes to face down old and new competitors and become the successful shipping magnate you once were? Because only then can you put a halt to Lydia Blythe-Smith's attacks once and for all. Campaign Features: 6 exciting chapters that gradually make the player familiar with all the game mechanics Three different medals per chapter increase replayability enormously Catch up with old acquaintances and meet some new ones while pitting yourself against unscrupulous rivals Also in all single-player modes: Steer your ships yourself in an immersive 3D mini game Multiplayer Mode In multiplayer mode you play against up to 7 real opponents. And you're going to need real strategic skill to stay ahead of the competition. With increasing pressure from your competitors you will also see your opportunities increase: Battle for economic domination in the different regions or engage in sabotage activities to damage your competitors. But think carefully: Your rivals won't just take that lying down. A single game is divided into several rounds in which you have to complete defined tasks in order to achieve Victory Points. The player who acquires the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins. Victory Point criteria are always randomly defined at the beginning of a game. You can manually set a game's duration. This means there's never an overriding optimum strategy and each game brings new challenges.

1034,8,Game,Large,Truberbrook,"the game  berbrook  is a thrilling mystery-sci-fi adventure game. Enjoy an adventurous vacation to a 1960's parallel universe! A Sci-Fi-Mystery Adventure Game with handmade scenery. Imagine yourself on a vacation to Europe in the late sixties. Now picture yourself as a young American scientist; Hans Tannhauser. Yes that's your name in this scenario. While you're at it think of Trberbrook a remote village in rural mountain-sloped and densely forested cold-war Germany. Because that's where you somehow end up after hitting the continent. But who cares you won the trip in a lottery! Or at least thats how it seems. But don't fear instead of getting some rest you could find yourself having to save the world Key features Suspense! Mystery! Thrills! After all it's a single player sci-fi mystery adventure game. We want to keep you entertained! Join American student Tannhauser stranger in a strange land Set in cold-war rural Germany in the late 1960s Inspired by Twin Peaks The X-Files Stranger Things & Star Trek Indulge in universal themes such as love friendship loyalty self-discovery and dinosaurs Handmade miniature scenery! Full voice acting in both English and German! Atmospheric moody soundtrack Up to 10 hours of super exciting gameplay! KICKSTARTER Trberbrook was successfully funded on Kickstarter in December 2017 within only 30 hours. The game will be enhanced by several new features thanks to the joint force of our 5078 wonderful backers! STORY The year is 1967. The world policy is dominated by the Cold War and Vietnam Russia and America are racing to the moon. At the same time in Europe students take to the streets from Paris to Berlin. On a larger scale the world is locked in turmoil but most people are unaware of the events unfolding in an overlooked sleepy part in the German province. Hans Tannhauser an American student in his late twenties is caught by surprise: Out of the blue he wins a trip to a small German village Trberbrook. Truber-what? No idea! It doesnt help he cant remember taking part in any lottery in the first place Happy to put some distance between him and his Ph.D. in quantum physics he makes his way to Trberbrook Germany bursting with curiosity. But shortly after his arrival inexplicable things start to happen: A mysterious stranger breaks into his room at the Guesthouse Waldeslust and steals a paper on physics. But who would do that? And why? Gradually he gets to know the various villagers and spa guests one more peculiar than the other. Only young anthropologist Greta Lemke who is on a research trip to Trberbrook seems normal to him. Before he knows it Greta becomes Tannhausers accomplice on the adventure of a lifetime! It slowly dawns on the aspiring physicist that his presence in Tberbrook is not accidental  he is here to save the world! CHARACTERS As the story proceeds Tannhauser teams up with Greta Lemke a student of paleoanthropology and bumps into the enigmatic inventor Lazarus Taft. Hans Tannhauser is an American physics student in his mid-twenties  and a clever one at that. The adorable little fellow is well-read always curious and of a deeply friendly nature. Greta Lemke was always the fiercest kid in the sandbox; cute but merciless if someone dared interrupting her excavations of twig bones and toy artefacts. The somewhat overenthusiastic student of paleoanthropology arrives in Trberbrook on an adventure to unravel the mysteries surrounding the village. As much a reclusive inventor as it gets Lazarus Taft quickly became talk of the town due to his superior card playing. There must be a reason he bought this costly old mansion in Trberbrook of all places What's up with Lazarus Taft? Trberbrook is full of quirky villagers tourists and strangers  like the gruffy but warm-hearted innkeeper Trude or her daughter Leni the weird kid from Trberbrook Elementary. And there's the old baron a veteran of two world wars or Lessing the prototype of modern day conspiracists. And of course Trbi the legendary lake monster. To name a few. HAND-CRAFTED SCENERY One of the most distinctive features of the game is the unique visual style. The sceneries are purely handmade. 'Handmade' as in: 'Manufactured using real hands!' And fingers! Not the most efficient way of doing things but certainly the most inefficient one. We're loving it though! Look at what we do here piece by piece by the sweat of our brows. Every little detail is custom-made. The models are digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and later retopologized. This way we get highly detailed polygon models that blend perfectly with our digital characters. It is a lot of work but also quite exciting! You may ask yourself how can they reach this level of detail? Are there very tiny people involved? They can't accomplish all of this with mere human hands right? Well yes we can! The answer might be our abundance of professional hands. Twenty-four seven at our disposal in all shapes and colors they get things done! Every scene gets an individual treatment and is staged with actual physical lighting. This allows us to simulate different hours of the day or weather conditions. Even a change of seasons is possible just by redecorating the set with real tiny little snowflakes no joke. This way we achieve an exceptional and magical look that visually reflects the world of Trberbrook. GAMEPLAY Trberbrook is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on characters and the narrative but includes a lot of puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story. The puzzles are designed to integrate into the narrative. You navigate Tannhauser through the different sceneries from a third person perspective usually in long distance shots to intensify the impression of peeking into a little diorama. The story unfolds as you interact with your environment talk to other characters and solve puzzles. These range from inventory-based puzzles to social challenges (such as persuading other characters) up to passing unsettling psycho tests. For the console versions we came up with a very intuitive controller input allowing you to move the line of sight and walking directions independently. For the PC versions you can choose between classic point and click mouse controls and the controller navigation. SOUNDTRACK The soundtrack of Trberbrook is an original composition to fit the mood of the game  sort of a tranquil doom jazz. Inspirations come from the works of Tom Waits Angelo Badalamenti Mark Lanegan Timber Timbre or Bohren & der Club of Gore. The soundtrack is directed by Sebastian Nagel & Albrecht Schrader. LOCALIZATION We've spent a lot of time working on a voice acting concept that joins in with the genetic code of the game. Since the protagonist is an American in the midst of a bunch of Germans we wanted to reflect this in our choice of actors: In the international English audio the main character Tannhauser speaks native American English while all of the townspeople of Trberbrook sport genuine German accents system requirements Windows - Minimum OS: Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10 Processor: i3 4th generation / i5 2nd generation / A6 series Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphic: Intel HD 4000 / AMD Radeon 5800 series / NVidia 550Ti DirectX: Version 11 Storage: 7 GB available space Soundcard: DX11 compatible Windows - Recommended OS: Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10 Processor: i3 5th generation (or newer) / i5 3rd generation (or newer) / FX4170 (or newer) Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphic: AMD Radeon 8000 series or newer / NVidia GTX 660 or newer DirectX: Version 11 Storage: 7 GB available space Soundcard: DX11 compatible Mac - Minimum OS: MAC OS X 10.11 or higher Processor: Intel Core i5 2.7Ghz Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphic: GeForce 775M | Radeon HD 6970 | Intel Iris Pro Storage: 7 GB available space Soundcard: DX11 compatible Additional Note: Minimum Resolution: 1280 x 720 Mac - Recommended OS: MAC OS X 10.14 Memory: 8 GB RAM Graphics: GeForce 775M | Radeon HD 6970 | Intel Iris Pro Storage: 7 GB available space Linux - Minimum OS: Ubuntu 16.04 Memory: 4 GB RAM Storage: 7 GB available space Linux - Recommended Memory: 8 GB RAM Storage: 7 GB available space Trberbrook is developed by btf and published by Headup GmbH.

1070,8,Game,Large,Windscape,the game Hi my name is Dennis and I am the creator of Windscape a first-person exploration adventure. Instead of just letting you read a boring game description please allow me to share my vision of the game I am creating. Hopefully you will like what I am working on. Ever since my childhood I was a huge fan of the Zelda series of games Golden Axe Warrior Secret of Mana and games in which let you explore a vivid world without time pressures and a too restrictive storyline. Over the past year and a half I've been working on my vision of a modern exploration adventure combining it with my fondness for modern crafting and sandbox games. In Windscape you play as a young girl living on your parents' farm set in a lovely world made up of floating islands in the sky. As you discover the world you learn that something has gone terribly wrong - islands are breaking apart and falling from the sky! It's up to you to discover the evil that is threatening the universe of Windscape. As you travel the world(s) you will gather valuable resources allowing you to craft a plethora of items such as weapons shields potions magical spells and much more. Some items will be just for fun while others are a necessity for your survival. You will meet peaceful NPCs and vicious monsters both on the surface of each island as well as in the dungeons and lairs you uncover along your journey. While I want the islands to work in a non-linear manner I have decided to make the dungeons more puzzle and combat driven - each with its own style and atmosphere. Windscape will feature tactical fights against larger bosses such as ghosts ogres and dragons. Of course there are many valuable items to loot too. What I don't want Windscape to be? A stats-driven RPG a terraforming sandbox game or a first-person action game. This is why I am asking for your support. I'm building this game for the community and hopefully with the community. I feel your feedback is really needed to match my vision with the high standards you the players demand. Because of this I have chosen to go into Early Access hoping to make great friends and build a community which shares my vision and aids me on my development quest'y Features One of my very first decisions was that I wanted the world to feel like a living and breathing environment. While I could have employed procedural world generation as so many other games do these days I have decided against this so I can flesh out the most beautiful corners of the world in detail. While this means that sadly there will be a point when 'u have seen it all'still feel very comfortable with my decision as it allows me to put you right into the world we're building with places to remember and stories to tell. I already have the game's universe mapped in my head but I also want the game to go where the community's input takes it too. For the final game I am planning for at least four very different maps and I'll appreciate the support on choosing the most fitting ones. The game starts on a pastoral island with peaceful nature a flourishing little village a water mill and many more idyllic spots to discover. Over the next few months I am looking forward to revealing more scenery and gathering valuable feedback from the players to help me make the next big decisions. Why always a boy? I hope you will come to love Ida as much as she has grown on me during the game's development. Sent out by her parents into the small neighborhood town to make a delivery Ida is yet unaware that soon the fate of the world will be resting solely upon her shoulders'have created a resource and crafting system which is intuitive to use but allows many things to be made. Basically you will find different crafting stations at key places all over the islands each enabling you to build different things if you have gathered the resources needed. You can cook healthy or just yummy food craft sweeping shields and weapons mix mysterious ingredients to create powerful magic potions melt iron and copper into new forms of metal and much much more. I want the dungeons to be an enthralling deviation of the more open exploration and story driven game that takes place on the islands surface. The first big dungeon you will encounter is a copper mine infested with rat-like enemies. Here you will also encounter the first bigger boss monster - with a great reward waiting for you if you make it out alive. Some dungeons will be an incremental part of the story while many others and smaller caves are hidden in the world for you to just discover. I hope you like my ideas of Windscape. Together we can all create a game which lives up to the vision I have set forth. Thank you for your support!
